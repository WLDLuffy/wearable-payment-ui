## About Me
I am a software engineer almost 5 years of working experience. I have been a Backend Engineer for most of my career. Only the first 1 year of my career I actually touched on full stack web development.

For this assessment, I took time to learn and build the application in Android kotlin using Jetpack Compose, which was a fun and fulfilling experience. I think my past experience in Java, as well as React.JS and React Native helped me to understand the syntax/ concepts behind mobile FE development with kotlin more easily.

I hope to have the opportunity to work in Mastercard as my experience in fintech companies has deepened my interest in the fintech industry.
